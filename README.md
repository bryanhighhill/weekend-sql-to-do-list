## Description
This app is a full-stack  "To Do" or "Task" list app. It provides the user with an input field where they can enter a new task, up to 100 characters in length.
Once the "submit task" button is clicked, the task is sent to the database with a status of incomplete.
All tasks are viewable beneath "task list" where they are appended to the dom with 2 buttons. The first button allows the user to update the task status to complete, and the second button allows the user to remove the task from the list. When a task is marked as complete, the styling changes, making it obvious if a task is complete or not.
